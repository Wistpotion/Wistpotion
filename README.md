#### Foreword  
Ok so naturally I will write in this once and then forget about it. So I'll try to keep it meme free because otherwise I'll look like a pleb!  
Things that are especially important to me are mark with (mildly) cringy emoticons <^^>

#### What do I do (currently)  
Music (right now edm and orchestral) (｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ  
Art (right now art x music projects with a digital/procedural-ish approach)  
Gamedev (I love löve2d) (～￣▽￣)～  
Electronics (guitar pedals! Anything that can make some analog / digital bleeps and bloops)  
Social interaction (yes I actually like doing that)  

#### What I have done / can (ish)
Unity (have done several games, pretty decent understanding)  
Gymnastics (if that ever becomes relevant)  
Gymnastics leader (I had the power to make about ten kids do spinny things, securely and with some sort of grace)  
Godot (have tried it enough to find my way around)  
Raspberry pi (love that little thing, it made me learn a bit of linux)  
3D / blender (absolutely shit at it, but I know my way around)
Image editing / design / photography (quite decent, not fantastic, but good enough for simple things)  \~(￣▽￣)\~  
Tutorials / teaching (it makes me feel smart and I like the feeling of having helped someone) (✿◡‿◡)  
Python / Scratch / C# (for unity) / Typescript / Web (js) / C++ (for arduino) 
Algebraic stuff (for some unearthly reason I think it's fun)  

#### What do I want to do (currently)
Collaborative projects are always a bop, so please contact me about any of that! ( •̀ ω •́ )✧  
Makeup (have been to lazy to try before)  
Small projects have are a bit more difficult or have novelty to them (novel for me so to speak)  
Any project where I get to do problem solving, then I probably want to do it!  
Learn some instruments (currently on bass and synth / keyboard)  
A more low level language like C / C++ / Rust (seems cool and really really fast)  

#### How to reach me
Feel free to yell at:  
discord (Wistpotion#7139)  
twitter (@wistpotion)  
gmail (guess three times, you can't get it wrong (ok you might actually so here it is (wistpotion@gmail.com (oh recursive paranthesis how interesting)))) (actually all those in the end were pretty ugly, might reformat)  


#### Pronouns (thank you github for reminding me to put this in)  
I'm a girl, and I use She/Her or They/Them. I really accept anything as long as it's not meant badly.  

#### Language
I'm a native swedish speaker, have basic basic german (it's awful), and am very fluent in english.

#### Fun facts
One of my biggest injuries were doing a piruette and smashing my toe into a doorway  
I really like mashed potatoes and unhealthy amounts of salt  
The project Twilight Trek was started because I went outside at 2am and took a walk  
I see it as my personal responsibility to get people to use emoticons instead of emojis
